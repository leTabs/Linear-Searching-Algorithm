# Lenear-Searching-Algorithm
The lenear searching algorithm is probably the simplest of the searching algorithms.
It checks each item in an array, if it does not match the searched target it moves to the next item.
The algorithm terminates once the target has been located or it has not found after checking the last item in the array 
It's woth noting that this type of search has a time handicap
