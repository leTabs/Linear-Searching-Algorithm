# Lenear-Searching-Algorithm


The linear search algorithm, also known as sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that searches a list of items one by one until the target item is found or the end of the list is reached. It starts at the beginning of the list and compares each element with the target element until a match is found.

Linear search is a straightforward and easy-to-implement algorithm, but it can be slow for large lists, especially if the target element is at the end of the list or not in the list at all. Its time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the list.

Linear search is useful in situations where the list is small or unsorted and the search rarely occurs or the time complexity is not critical. However, for large or sorted lists, more efficient algorithms such as binary search or interpolation search should be used.
